                <p>"<strong>Hidden Figures</strong>" is a biographical drama film released in 2016, directed by Theodore Melfi and based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film tells the untold true story of three African-American women mathematicians who played pivotal roles at NASA during the early years of the U.S. space program.

                    Set in the 1960s during the height of the Cold War and the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film follows the lives of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, three brilliant women working as "human computers" at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia.
                    
                    Katherine Johnson, portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, is a gifted mathematician who becomes integral to the calculations necessary for the success of John Glenn's historic orbit around the Earth. Despite facing racial and gender discrimination, Katherine's expertise and perseverance make her indispensable to the mission.
                    
                    Dorothy Vaughan, played by Octavia Spencer, is a supervisor in the segregated West Area Computers division. She recognizes the threat posed by the introduction of IBM computers and takes it upon herself to learn programming, ultimately becoming NASA's first African-American supervisor.
                    
                    Mary Jackson, portrayed by Janelle Monáe, dreams of becoming an engineer but faces obstacles due to racial segregation in education. With the support of her colleagues and a landmark court case, Mary breaks down barriers and becomes NASA's first African-American female engineer.
                    
                    Throughout the film, the three women navigate systemic racism and sexism in both society and the workplace, overcoming numerous challenges to make significant contributions to NASA's success. "Hidden Figures" highlights their remarkable achievements and sheds light on their vital yet overlooked roles in the history of space exploration.</p>
