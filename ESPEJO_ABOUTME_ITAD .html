  <blockquote> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My <strong>childhood years</strong>, I really don't remember much about my childhood years, but here are some precious memories that I can still recall.<sup>1</sup> I remember back then, there were no gadgets, all the kids were outside their houses playing under the scorching sun.<sup>2</sup> I was a shy child back then, but my cousins were always by my side to speak up for me.<sup>3</sup> I have this one super close cousin; we always wore matching clothes in different colors – mine was yellow, and hers was pink.<sup>4</sup> Despite having different personalities, we were incredibly close.<sup>5</sup>
Our favorite outdoor games were Chinese garter, ice ice water, hopscotch, and many more.<sup>6</sup> By the way, I grew up on my father's side, as I come from a broken family.<sup>7</sup> I was a Lola's girl; I remember that no one was allowed to seek affection from my grandma, especially when it was my turn for cuddles.<sup>8</sup>

One of my favorite things we used to do when I was a kid was to go home to our province.<sup>9</sup> Every vacation, we made sure to go back to the province.<sup>10</sup> Of course, it's a province life, swimming in the sea, catching shells, watching the sunrise and sunset.<sup>11</sup> And because we're in the province, we have mini outings and mini reunions with our relatives.<sup>12</sup> My favorite spot in our house in the province is the small store because I get free candy there.<sup>13</sup> We also love hanging out at my grandma's nipa hut, where we cousins stay overnight.<sup>14</sup>
  
I had a penchant for dressing up, wearing my favorite gown every birthday, even if the celebration was at home.<sup>15</sup> Girly things like hair accessories, nail polish, kids' makeup, and various accessories captivated my interest.<sup>16</sup> Family trips to Luneta Park became a tradition, with the dinosaur exhibit being my favorite spot.<sup>17</sup> My grandparents fondly recalled how I used to cry whenever I got too close to the dinosaurs, and we would share hearty laughs over those memories.<sup>18</sup>

Reflecting on these cherished moments, I yearn for the carefree innocence of my childhood.<sup>19</sup> That once-innocent child is gradually blossoming into a young lady, marking the passage of time and the evolution of self.<sup>20</sup>

 <blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my <strong>teenage years</strong>, I noticed changes in my body due to puberty.<sup>1</sup> I began enjoying weekends with friends and classmates, as high school life allows us to have fun, especially after school.<sup>2</sup> In 7th grade, I was initially shy after transferring schools, but over time, I formed a new circle of friends.<sup>3</sup>

That's when my crush era began.<sup>4</sup> In 9th grade, I joined COCC/ROTC, and I recall how tiring the training was – every day felt like a week.<sup>5</sup> Waking up early was a must to avoid being late, or I'd face punishment.<sup>6</sup> The last day, "hell day," involved challenging tasks and playful teasing from officers.<sup>7</sup> Despite the hardships, we earned our positions as officers for the next school year, making the training memorable.<ing a slow learner easier.<sup>11</sup> People say college life is hard, but I think it's challenging if you're surrounded by the wrong crowd and lack motivation.<sup>12</sup>

As I got more into my classes and coding, I started to enjoy my studies.<sup>13</sup> I'm grateful for friends who are always there to help and guide me.<sup>14</sup> I still have two years left (hopefully and claiming), and this journey is a roller coaster ride – full of cramming, stress, tears, overthinking, fun, enjoyment, slow days, and memories.<sup>15</sup>

I'll cherish every small moment of these college years because entering the workforce will be a new chapter in my life.<sup>16</sup> For now, I'm testing myself to see how far I can go to earn that degree and make my parents proud.<sup>17</sup>sup>8</sup>

In 10th grade, I entered a "serious" relationship, which was a roller coaster as having a boyfriend wasn't allowed.<sup>9</sup> I sneaked out for dates.<sup>10</sup> Senior High School brought the pandemic and lockdown.<sup>11</sup> During this time, I focused on self-love, exercised, achieved my goal body, learned new hobbies, and practiced instruments.<sup>12</sup> The lockdown strengthened my family bonds, and we enjoyed activities like cooking, cleaning, karaoke, eating, and chatting together.<sup>13</sup>At this period of time, my grandfather had serious illness due to diabetes and prostate.<sup>14</sup> But he made sure that he won't be a hindrance to his children, despite of having a hard time.<sup>15</sup> He manages to join us in every gatherings.<sup>16</sup>

When the lockdown ended, I picked up cycling as a new sport, bonding with my dad.<sup>17</sup> It's the only sport we both enjoy.<sup>18</sup> I can say I had a wonderful teenage experience with amazing people around me.<sup>19</sup> I often reflect on these memories and lessons, carrying them into my future.<sup>20</sup</p></blockquote>

   <blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently in my <strong>college years</strong>, embarking on a new phase of life.<sup>1</sup> I attend the University of the East Manila Campus, majoring in BSIT.<sup>2</sup> Initially, I wanted to study Tourism, but I switched to BSIT because my aunt, who works in IT, graduated from the University of the East.<sup>3</sup>

In my first year, first semester, classes were online, and I wasn't excited about them.<sup>4</sup> I found it hard to understand what the professors were teaching because I didn't like the subjects.<sup>5</sup> Fortunately, in the second semester, we had blended learning.<sup>6</sup> I made new friends and found my circle, overcoming my initial shyness when I joined a new section.<sup>7</sup>

During face-to-face sessions, we had jamming sessions during vacant periods.<sup>8</sup> Now, each semester, we ensure we enroll in the same block section so no one gets left behind.<sup>9</sup> My friends have had a significant impact on my college life, making it more bearable.<sup>10</sup>

     I often ask myself, "Maybe that's why I chose BSIT as my program", My friends make being a slow learner easier.<sup>11</sup> People say college life is hard, but I think it's challenging if you're surrounded by the wrong crowd and lack motivation.<sup>12</sup>

As I got more into my classes and coding, I started to enjoy my studies.<sup>13</sup> I'm grateful for friends who are always there to help and guide me.<sup>4</sup> I still have two years left (hopefully and claiming), and this journey is a roller coaster ride – full of cramming, stress, tears, overthinking, fun, enjoyment, slow days, and memories.<sup>15</sup>Each lecture held the potential to shape my future.<sup>16</sup>

I'll cherish every small moment of these college years because entering the workforce will be a new chapter in my life.<sup>17</sup> For now, I'm testing myself to see how far I can go to earn that degree and make my parents proud.<sup>18</sup> I never imagined the growth and experience this chapter has given me.<sup>19</sup>This journey might be full of roller coaster but I'll make sure this journey will bring me to success.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
